These are examples illustrating the use of some of the C++11/14/17 features used in the [booklet about C++11/14/17 language](https://www.bbv.ch/de/index.php/?option=com_content&view=article&id=186&Itemid=361#c-11-14-sprach-und-standard-library-erweiterungen) (*german*) produced by bbv software services

# Supported Compilers

 * g++ 7.0.1 - All examples compile and run
 * clang 5.0.0 - All examples compile and run
 * MSVC 14.1 (Visual Studio 2017) - C++14 complete, missing most of the C++17 features 
 

Tip: use  https://godbolt.org/ to test various other compilers


# Building with CMake
CMake will generate a makefile that will create an make target/executable for each *.cc file. At the moment (29. June 2017) only gcc 7.0.1 is C++17 feature complete. CMake will build makefiles for other compilers as well, but some examples will fail to compile.
To specify a non-default compiler (i.e. g++7) to use  `$CC` and `$CXX` environment variables or use `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-7` to specify the compiler to use.

As soon as more and more compilers are able to compile the full C++17 feature set they will be added.
If you find one missing, raise an issue on github for it. https://github.com/bernedom/CPP_Booklet

## building and compiling
`$>cmake .`

`$>make`

Or 

`$>cmake .`

`$>cmake --build . --target all`

### building and compiling with non-feature complete compilers
As most make tools (GNU make, nmake) exit if a target fails to build additional options have to be passed to make to continue even on a failed target
for GNU make use `$>make -i` for nmake use `$>nmake -I` if using cmake to build use `$>cmake --build . --target all` 

### Including intentionally broken code
Some examples contain code that is intentionally to fail to compile. Usually this is done to illustrate some C++ feature. To compile the sources to allow for such failure use. Note the use of the -i flags else make stops on the first failure
`$>make clean`
`$>make CXX_FLAGS+=-DEXPECT_FAILED_COMPILATION -i`

Or if using cmake directly to build
`$>cmake --build . --target all -- CXX_FLAGS+=-DEXPECT_FAILED_COMPILATION -i` 

# Compiling by hand:
clang: `$>clang++ -std=c++1z file.cc -o file.exe`

g++: `$>g++ -std=c++17 file.cc -o file.exe`

use `$>clang++ -std=c++1z -S` to compile to assembler code

## Formatting:
All examples are formatted using clang-format
`$>clang-format -i file.cc` for formatting

# generating html output
to generate syntax highlighed html files for each file in ./source you need ```vim``` with syntax highlighting and a colorscheme enabledd. if you have this simply run ```generate_html.sh``` and it will drop the generated files into the folder /html
